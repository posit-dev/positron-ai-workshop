In 2019, the United States was the `r us_rank`th happiest country in the world.

```{r}
ggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = `GDP per capita`, y = Score)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3, color = grey70) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Happiness vs GDP per Capita (2019)",
       subtitle = "World Happiness Report Data",
       x = "GDP per Capita",
       y = "Happiness Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))
```

Compare this to the happiest countries in 2019.
